# Kurisutaru Userscript Collections

A curated collection of userscripts that I create to enhance your browsing experience across various websites.

## What are Userscripts?

Userscripts are small JavaScript programs that modify web pages in your browser to add features, enhance functionality, or customize the appearance of websites. They run locally in your browser and can automate tasks, remove annoying elements, add new features, or completely redesign websites according to your preferences.

## Getting Started
